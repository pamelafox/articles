Learning a new framework or development environment is made even more difficult when you don't know the programming language. Fortunately, we're here to help! We've created this series of videos to focus on the core concepts of JavaScript. 

**The full video series is available for free here:**
**[Beginner's Series to JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript?WT.mc_id=jsbeginner-devto-yolasors)**

This series of 51 videos is designed to be consumed as you see fit. You can watch from start to finish, or you can dive into specific topics. You can always bookmark and come back as you need. 

## What you'll learn

The videos take you from the very beginning on how to set up your machine and install the tools you need to develop JavaScript code. After that, you'll dive into the JavaScript syntax and structure including objects, functions, logic, and more. Finally, once the basics are covered you'll get to know about more advanced topics like asynchronous programming and how to use packages to develop apps more efficiently.

Most topics will be covered by explaining first the concepts behind, then show you a demo on how you can use it in your code. All the code used in the demos is also available on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/beginners-intro-javascript-node).

## What's coming next?

This is only the beginning of your learning journey, and once you're up to speed with JavaScript, maybe you'll want to get started with Node.js?

If you're going that path, you can take a look at this [full interactive Learn path on Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-javascript-applications-nodejs/?WT.mc_id=nodebeginner-devto-cxa) with 5 in-depth tutorials for learning Node.js.

We have a lot more content in the pipe, so stay tuned ðŸ˜‰

## Tell us your experience

While we don't cover every aspect of JavaScript in these videos, we want to help you build a foundation from which you can continue to grow. By the end of this series, you'll be able to work through tutorials, quick starts, books, and other resources, continuing to grow on your own.

We're also looking to improve, so please tell us what you think of the format, what were your difficulties and how was your experience in the comments.

Time to learn some JavaScript! ðŸŽ‰
