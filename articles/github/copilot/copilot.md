You've probably heard of GitHub Copilot, the tool that provides you code suggestions based on your current code, using a model trained on GitHub from a huge corpus of open source code.

I've been using it for a while now, and sometimes I find it's really helpful, sometimes not so much. But there are times when the results are really impressive, almost feeling as magic.

And there are times when I really wondered how this magic could be achieved. The suggestions were so good that it feeled like it was connected with my mind and knew exactly what I wanted to do next. Even better than pair programming with a real human I would say. And somehow it's frightening to think about.

Copilot is based on the [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165) family of algorithms, a model that isn't available publicy, mostly because of concerns about its potential misuse, particularly in the context of misinformation and fake news.
