Since I've discovered this website, **dev.to** has been my favorite way for getting and sharing content with the community. I fell in love with this platform for dev content, just like I fell in love with GitHub for open source development. And when I love something, I have to give back ♥️.

My way to give back to this wonderful community is to present you **a new CLI made for dev.to authors**.

## What is this new CLI?

## What can I use it for?

## Setting up a GitHub repo synchronized with dev.to


### Future plans

Nothing is set in stone, but here are some ideas I have in mind for the future of this tool.

- Make it a VS Code extension: because not everyone like CLI.
- Bootstrap a personal blog automatically using the markdown files, and manage canonical URLs for you.
- Synchronize back changes made on dev.to website, in case you need a quick edit on the go. Using [webhooks](https://docs.dev.to/api/#tag/webhooks), it would even be possible to automatically merge the changes back in your repo using the GitHub Action.
- You name it? This project is not just Open Source in name, your contributions and ideas are welcome ♥️.

I would love to hear you feedback and ideas in the comments!
Thanks for being here and taking part in this awesome community.

**YOU ROCK!**
